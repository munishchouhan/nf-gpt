# nf-ai plugin 
 
nf-ai is an experimental plugin to integrate GPT prompt into Nextflow script. 

## Get started

1. Configure the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key in your environment by using the following variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

2. Add the following snippet at the beginning of your script:

```nextflow
include { prompt } from 'plugin/nf-ai'
```

3. Use the `prompt` operator to perform a ChatGPT query and collect teh result to a map object having the schema
of your choice, e.g.

```
include { prompt } from 'plugin/nf-ai'

def text = '''
Extract information about a person from In 1968, amidst the fading echoes of Independence Day,
a child named John arrived under the calm evening sky. This newborn, bearing the surname Doe,
marked the start of a new journey.
'''

channel
     .of(text)
     .prompt(schema: [firstName: 'string', lastName: 'string', birthDate: 'date (YYYY-MM-DD)'])
     .view()
```

4. run using nextflow as usual

```
nextflow run <my script>
```

See the folder [examples] for more examples


## Testing and debugging

To build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:

1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow
    ```
  
2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:
    ```bash
    echo "includeBuild('../nextflow')" >> settings.gradle
    ```
  
   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)

3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:
    ```bash
    make assemble
    ```

4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-ai` to load the plugin:
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-ai
    ```

## Testing without Nextflow build

The plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:

1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`
2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`
3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`

## Package, upload, and publish

The project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-ai`).

Follow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:

1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):

   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.
   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.
   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.
   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.

2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-ai:upload
    ```

3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.
